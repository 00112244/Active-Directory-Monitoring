# Active Directory Monitoring Projects



This repository contains a collection of practical projects focused on monitoring **Active Directory (AD)** environments using modern observability and SIEM tools. Each project demonstrates real-world use cases relevant to **log monitoring, security event detection, visualization, and alerting** for AD infrastructure.

---

## Purpose

* Demonstrate how to monitor and analyze Active Directory logs using different platforms.
* Showcase integration with visualization and alerting tools.
* Apply monitoring queries, dashboards, and alerts for detecting anomalies.
* Provide reproducible steps for building hands-on AD monitoring lab environments.

## Project List

### 1. Active Directory Monitoring with Grafana

**Description:** Demonstrates how to collect and visualize Active Directory metrics using Grafana and Prometheus Windows Exporter, enabling real-time monitoring of AD health, performance, and security events.

**Key Features:**
* Full setup of Prometheus Windows Exporter on Windows Server hosting AD DS.
* Prometheus configuration for scraping AD metrics.
* Grafana dashboards for CPU, memory, disk, and AD-specific events.
* Setting up real-time alerts for performance and security issues.

**Highlights:**
* Visualizing user logon events, failed logons, and account lockouts.
* Monitoring AD performance metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.
* Security-focused dashboards showing failed logons, account lockouts, and privilege escalations.
* Real-time notifications via Grafana alerts for critical AD events.
